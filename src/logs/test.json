The graph should have a clear distinction between the two stations, and the x-axis should display the corresponding dates, while the y-axis should display the rainfall amounts.\\n\\nFrom the provided attributes, we can identify the following relevant attributes:\\n\\n* 'Rainfall' (y-axis): This attribute is a clear match for the rainfall measurements mentioned in the prompt.\\n* 'Date' (x-axis): This attribute is necessary to display the corresponding dates on the x-axis.\\n\\nSince the prompt mentions two stations, Station 2 and Station 3, we might need an additional attribute to distinguish between the two stations. However, there is no explicit attribute in the provided list that indicates the station number. Therefore, we will assume that the data is already separated by station, and we can focus on the 'Rainfall' and 'Date' attributes.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, my answer is:\\n\\n[\\\"Date\\\", \\\"Rainfall\\\"]\"], \"transformations\": [\"none\"], \"transformationReasoning\": [\"[\\\"none\\\"]\"]}"
